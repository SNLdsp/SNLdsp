- 👋 Hi, I’m @SNLdsp
- 👀 I’m interested in how matlab DSP functions and their corresponding Verilog implementations are involved in a vector-file-based bit-by-bit verification process.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning matlab and revising what I've learned about DSP at Stanford University.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on DSP projects in which DSP functions need to be implemented in Verilog.
- 📫 How to reach me howgreathouart@gmail.com
